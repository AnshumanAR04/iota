# iota
iota is a service that is designed to felicitate the university in allocating marks to the students based on the number of problems they have solved across various competitive programming platforms like codechef, hackerrank, spoj etc. Once given the username iota appends it to the rightful url and then scraps the data from the page and the extracted data can be stored in various formats like csv, json or directly to a database like mongoDB. iota uses a highly efficient and fast framework for web scraping (Scrapy) which gives it an edge over other scrapers which use frameworks like beautifulsoup etc. Additions will be made to the source code and new features will be added.
